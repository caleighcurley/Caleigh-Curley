Cataloh Description
======
This course examines research ethics and review processes through an Indigenous lens. Utilizing research and ethics frameworks from a diverse array of disciplines and geographies, this course explores the history of research and ethics by, with, and for Indigenous Peoples, communities, and nations. We will investigate Indigenous research frameworks, the intersection of Indigenous methodologies and research ethics, data typologies and practices, open-source data ethical considerations, and intersectional relationships for systemic change.

Course Description
======
This is an Indigenous public health policy and research ethics course. As such, many of the topics will focus on human health and wellbeing, although the course content draws from an array of disciplines and communities. The intention of this course is to introduce students with and without public health experience to a wide variety of Indigenous research and ethics topics and issues through readings, activities, guest speakers, and self-reflection in a discussion-based learning environment, and to be able to apply those learnings more broadly within their own disciplines.
