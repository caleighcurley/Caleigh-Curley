I am one of three Zuckerman College of Public Health staff and faculty members laying the groundwork for the next generation of students to develop a deeper understanding of Indigenous rights and governance as mentors in the Mo’s Policy Scholars program. 

What is the Mo's Policy Scholars Program?
======
Mo's Policy Scholars is a competitive 14-week paid mentorship program for 9 UArizona students (juniors & seniors only) who are interested in having an impact on environmental and Indigenous governance policy.

What do Mo's Policy Scholars do?

If selected, you will be assigned your own mentor from the Udall Center’s pool of UArizona faculty research professionals, each of whom are experts in their field and have extensive research and publishing experience. This is a great opportunity to get real, professional academic experience in your field of study and in policy-adjacent research in general.
