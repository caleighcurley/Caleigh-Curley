My name is Caleigh Curley. I am a citizen of the Diné and Hopi Tribe; raised in Ganado, Arizona, within the Navajo Nation and now living on O’odam lands as a Doctoral Candidate in the Public Health Policy and Management Program at the University of Arizona (UArizona) Mel and Enid Zuckerman College of Public Health (MEZCOPH) and [Collaboratory for Indigenous Data Governance Scholar](https://indigenousdatalab.org/team-member-caleigh-curley/). I earned a Bachelor of Science in Biomedical Sciences and a Master of Public Health in Health Promotion from Northern Arizona University. My research explores the intersection of Indigenous health, public health policy, and data governance. I have over six years of experience working with Tribes, Tribal colleges and universities, Tribal organizations, and urban Indian organizations. I am passionate about improving the health of Tribal nations through health policy and look forward to learning more about policy development and analysis in my DrPH studies. My goal is to apply what I have learned to provide expert analysis, advice, and guidance to senior and political leadership on policy, regulatory, and legislative issues that have significant and direct impacts on the health of Indigenous Peoples.
