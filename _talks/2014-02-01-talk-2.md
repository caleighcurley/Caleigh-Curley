With leadership support and funding to modernize its public health infrastructure, the Arizona Department of Health Services (ADHS) is pursuing policies to advance data sharing with tribal nations. This includes working with the Native Nation Institute to provide training on tribal sovereignty and cultural humility for staff. It has also developed a tribal handbook for public health staff on sovereignty, cultural trauma, and the roles of IHS and TECs.
