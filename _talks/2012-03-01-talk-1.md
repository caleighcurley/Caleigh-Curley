The Navajo Nation Department of Health is proud to present research on cancer and the Navajo people. The Navajo Cancer Workgroup has produced three major reports—Cancer Among the Navajo, 1995-2004, 2005-2013, and 2014-2018—based on high-quality, population-based tumor and cancer registry data on incidence, stage at diagnosis, and mortality from the six counties that include the Navajo Nation. The results indicate significantly higher rates of kidney, liver, stomach and gallbladder cancer and lower rates of lung cancer, compared to the U.S. population. Navajo are also diagnosed at later stages than the U.S. population for breast, colorectal and cervical cancer.
